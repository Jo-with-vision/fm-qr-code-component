## My process (WIP)

Included within the Initial commit:

1. Tidied up the FM directory, removing the design folder and style guide and updating the README.md with my own information.
2. Improved the starter HTML by adding a main sectioning element to contain my solution, and added the FM attribution inside a footer sectioning element. I added the attribution line of text inside a paragraph element, and added my name and FM profile to the link.
3.  Created an external stylesheet and linked to it within the HTML head section.
4. Included the import for the appropriate Google Font in the CSS.
5. Declared basic styling for colours as variables in the CSS, using the style guide information.
6. Added the universal selector and box-sizing set to border-box to make measurements easier.


### Built with
